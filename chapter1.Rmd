#### My Answers:
I am feeling a bit **overwhelmed**, but I am going to keep an open mind on learning these new tools. I am hoping to learn about new systems that will allow me to collaborate on projects and learn **more** about coding. I heard about this course through a **Yammer** group that I follow. I have informed others in my department and former classmates about the course also.
